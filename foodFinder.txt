"Food Finder"

This app allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients they have on hand. The app would use the Spoonacular API to retrieve recipe data, and display it in a user-friendly interface.

The app would allow users to:

- Search for recipes by entering ingredients they have on hand
- View recipe information, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information
- Filter search results by cuisine, meal type, and dietary restrictions
- Save favorite recipes for quick access
- Generate a shopping list based on selected recipes
- Google Maps API, to display the locations of nearby grocery stores.
