            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
            Even the most experienced cooks can run into problems in the
            kitchen. Here are some common cooking issues and how to fix them:
            <div className="troubleshooting-container">
              <div className="troubleshooting-element">
                Burnt food: If your food is burnt, remove it from the heat
                immediately. Try scraping off the burnt parts or trimming them
                away. Next time, try cooking at a lower temperature or for a
                shorter amount of time.
              </div>
              <div className="troubleshooting-element">
                Overcooked or undercooked food: If your food is overcooked or
                undercooked, adjust the cooking time or temperature for next
                time. For meats and poultry, use a food thermometer to ensure
                they're cooked to a safe internal temperature.
              </div>
              <div className="troubleshooting-element">
                Lumpy sauces or gravies: If your sauce or gravy is lumpy, try
                whisking vigorously or using an immersion blender to smooth it
                out. You could also strain it through a fine-mesh sieve.
              </div>
              <div className="troubleshooting-element">
                Dry or tough meat: If your meat is dry or tough, it may have
                been overcooked. Try cooking at a lower temperature or for a
                shorter amount of time. You could also try marinating the meat
                before cooking to help tenderize it.
              </div>
              <div className="troubleshooting-element">
                Flat baked goods: If your baked goods turn out flat, it may be
                due to old baking powder or baking soda. Make sure to use fresh
                leavening agents and follow the recipe carefully.
              </div>
              <div className="troubleshooting-element">
                Stuck-on food: If food is stuck to the bottom of the pan, try
                soaking the pan in hot, soapy water. You could also use a
                spatula or scraper to loosen the food.
              </div>
              <div className="troubleshooting-element">
                Too salty or too spicy: If your dish is too salty or too spicy,
                try diluting it with additional ingredients or serving it with a
                neutralizing food like bread or rice.
              </div>
            </div>
            Remember, cooking is all about experimentation and learning from
            your mistakes. Don't be afraid to try new things and make
            adjustments along the way.
